Another demo program to use command line input from user.

Note::
- to_lowercase() turns string slice to String.
- Match needs same type to evaluate.
 - .to_str() converts String to &str

- read_line returns Result.
- is_ok() is defined in Result.

Run cargo check to check error, it is faster than cargo run since it only checks the issue.
